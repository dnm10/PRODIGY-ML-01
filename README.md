# 🏡 House Price Prediction – Linear Regression

This project implements a **Linear Regression** model to predict housing prices based on selected features. It uses the [Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) dataset.

---

## 📌 Objective

Build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate the **sale price of houses** based on:

- 🏠 Above-ground living area (square footage)
- 🛏️ Number of bedrooms
- 🛁 Number of full bathrooms

---

## 🧠 Model Overview

- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
- **Framework**: Scikit-learn
- **Evaluation Metric**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Tools**: Python, pandas, matplotlib

---

## 📊 Results
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) is printed as an evaluation metric

- A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted prices is generated to visualize accuracy
